This project is a web-based platform that helps people in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities discover nearby jobs, services, skilling centres, rentals, and essential daily-needs providers. Most opportunities exist within a few kilometres of the user but remain invisible due to scattered information, unreliable sources, and lack of a trusted discovery layer.
Our platform solves this by showing verified, hyperlocal opportunities on an interactive map, with simple posting tools and multilingual support.
